# Setting up a version control repo for R project directly through R Studio is the best option.
# 
# 1. Create a repo from github. 
# If you add a READ.ME, you will need to pull the repo from origin master. Best practice is to add the READ>ME later after first commit.
# 2. Create a project directory and initialize with git version control
# 3. Make changes to the project directory; commit the changes through three step:
#   a. Stage the new changes
#   b. click commit and add message
#   c. click push
# 4. Confirm changes in github repo
# 5. Create READ.ME, if applicable.
# 6. Git pull through R Studio (Git > Pull Branch)
